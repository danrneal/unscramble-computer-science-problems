# Unscramble Computer Science Problems

Five tasks based on a fabricated set of calls and texts exchanged during September 2016 with run time analysis.

## Usage

A description of each task can be found in the docstring of each file. Each task can be run by simply calling the file. For instance, you can run Task 0 as follows:

```bash
Task0.py
```

Accompanying run time analysis in big O notation is documented in `analysis.txt`.
